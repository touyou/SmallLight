- `swift build --product SmallLight` – build the resident app host.
- `swift run SmallLight` – run the app during development.
- `swift test` – execute package unit/integration tests quickly.
- `xcodebuild test -scheme SmallLight-Package -destination 'platform=macOS'` – full Xcode-driven tests (also via `mise run test`).
