# Work Log - 2025-10-28

## Session Timeline
- 10:05 Investigated existing compression flow: reviewed `DefaultActionOrchestrator`, `AppCoordinator`, `FileCompressionService`.
- 10:12 Inspected cursor visual pipeline (`CursorVisualController`, `CursorAssetLoader`) to understand current idle/listening behavior.
- 10:18 Mapped Finder resolution stack (`FinderItemResolver`, `HoverMonitor`, overlay manager) to trace trigger conditions.
- 10:31 Reproduced build failure: `AppCoordinator` initializer lacks `compressionService` dependency in app/tests, confirming why compression path never executed.
- 10:47 Injected `FileCompressionService` into `SmallLightApp` and boxed compression dependency in `AppCoordinator` to restore compression flow and satisfy Sendable checks.
- 10:55 Updated AppCoordinator unit/system tests to pass compression stubs; added new compression acceptance coverage and idle cursor test harness.
- 11:05 Implemented initial-idle cursor fix so Option-up state displays the custom asset immediately.
- 11:24 Ran `swift test` to verify compression and cursor scenarios (39 tests passing).

## Outstanding Goals
- Prepare summary and next-step guidance for handoff.
