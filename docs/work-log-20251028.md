# Work Log - 2025-10-28

## Session Timeline
- 10:05 Investigated existing compression flow: reviewed `DefaultActionOrchestrator`, `AppCoordinator`, `FileCompressionService`.
- 10:12 Inspected cursor visual pipeline (`CursorVisualController`, `CursorAssetLoader`) to understand current idle/listening behavior.
- 10:18 Mapped Finder resolution stack (`FinderItemResolver`, `HoverMonitor`, overlay manager) to trace trigger conditions.
- 10:31 Reproduced build failure: `AppCoordinator` initializer lacks `compressionService` dependency in app/tests, confirming why compression path never executed.
- 10:47 Injected `FileCompressionService` into `SmallLightApp` and boxed compression dependency in `AppCoordinator` to restore compression flow and satisfy Sendable checks.
- 10:55 Updated AppCoordinator unit/system tests to pass compression stubs; added new compression acceptance coverage and idle cursor test harness.
- 11:05 Implemented initial-idle cursor fix so Option-up state displays the custom asset immediately.
- 11:24 Ran `swift test` to verify compression and cursor scenarios (39 tests passing).
- 11:32 Added idle/listening overlay indicator states with continuous cursor tracking when Option is released; HoverMonitor now streams movement events even without modifiers.
- 11:36 Adjusted tests and stubs for new overlay API; re-ran `swift test` (39 tests passing).
- 11:45 Fixed idle overlay mirroring by converting screen coordinates via `NSWindow.convertPoint(fromScreen:)`; regression suite remains green.
- 11:58 Adjusted overlay y-axis mapping to counter CALayer geometry flip; verified with `swift test`.
- 12:06 Refactored overlay indicator layers to use anchored circles + positional updates, fixing external display offset; suite still green.
- 12:14 Restored indicator visibility toggles (no more path clearing) and set HiDPI scaling; `swift test` remains green.
- 12:25 Refined overlay window visibility to only track the active display, added edge-inclusive screen checks, and reran `swift test` (39 tests passing).
- 12:32 Limited overlay rendering to the Option-held window state, keeping the indicator hidden otherwise, and verified with `swift test` (39 tests passing).
- 12:38 Normalized CGEvent coordinates via `NSEvent(cgEvent:)` so overlay/HUD operate in AppKit space; reran `swift test` (39 tests passing).
- 13:12 Introduced HUD positioning modes, pinned HUD to top-left while keeping compression/decompression flows intact; regression suite green (39 tests).
- 13:18 Split hover coordinates so overlays use AppKit space while Finder hit tests keep Quartz positions; `swift test` still green (39 tests).
- 13:25 Restored idle overlay visuals, started HUD hidden, added modifier toggle regression test to cover cursor/listening transitions; `swift test` (40) passing.

## Outstanding Goals
- Communicate overlay alignment fix and suggest manual verification.
